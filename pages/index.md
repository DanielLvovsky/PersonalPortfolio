Hey, I am Daniel Lvovsky, a Front-End Developer and Graphic Designer.

I love programming and creating things. I started learning programming back in 2018 starting with Java but quickly transitioned to JavaScript as I was more interested in making web applications. Currently I am learning React.js, Electron and Python and I am on the lookout for a job oppurtunity in Front-End Development.

Currently I am a team lead for an upcoming [Bannerlord Mod Shokuho](https://www.moddb.com/mods/shokuho) where I manage and lead the Design team where we work on concept art, UI elements and gameplay art. We are planning on releasing the mod later this year in 2021. Our mod has been publized on many youtube channels as well as gaining over 200k views on our ModDB page. I am very proud on being part of this team and this amazing community!

Outside of programming, I enjoy doing graphic design, 3D art and gaming. You can find my work on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/daniel_lvovsky). If you happen to have a project that needs to be expanded you can contact me anytime and we can explore it together.
